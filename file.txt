 In the general sense, a text file refers to any file that has only text and is void of images and other non-text characters. These sometimes use the TXT file extension but don't necessarily need to. For example, a Word document that is an essay containing just text can be in the DOCX file format but still be called a text file.

Another kind of text file is the "plain text" file. This is a file that contains zero formatting (unlike RTF files), meaning nothing is bold, italic, underlined, colored, using a special font, etc. Several examples of plain text file formats include ones that end in XML, REG, BAT, PLS, M3U, M3U8, SRT, IES, AIR, STP, XSPF, DIZ, SFM, THEME, and TORRENT.

Of course, files with the .TXT file extension are text files, too, and are commonly used to store things that can be easily opened with any text editor or written to with a simple script. Examples might include storing step-by-step instructions for how to use something, a place to hold temporary information, or logs generated by a program (though those are usually stored in a LOG file).

"Plaintext," or cleartext files, are different than "plain text" files (with a space). If file storage encryption or file transfer encryption isn't used, the data can be said to exist in plaintext or be transferred over plaintext. This can be applied to anything that should be secured but isn't, be it emails, messages, plain text files, passwords, etc., but it's usually used in reference to cryptography.
